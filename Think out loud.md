# Context

No one knows what to do next.

# Purpose

Get partial ideas into the mob so they can act as the seed for genius.

# How To

When the mob starves for next steps and goes quiet, speak your partial ideas even if you don't see how they can help. 

If you hear a partial idea, welcome it so the speaker knows they did good. Then riff on it.

If a partial idea is actionable, start applying it to see what happens.

# Mobbing-Pattern-Language

Successful mobs don't all behave the same way. Sometimes mobs could be more successful but don't see what they might change.

As a pattern language, you should not try to apply all of these patterns at once. Each one has a context in which it is applicable, and a context in which it becomes an anti-pattern.
